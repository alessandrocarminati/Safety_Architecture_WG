funcParser Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha Release v1.0 feature set:
- Specification of SW module(s) and source file(s) to scan by means of JSON
  configuration file.
- Parse (C language) source files looking for FFI relevant information, such
  as:
	- function definitions
	- function calls
	- function pointers
	- function macros
- Dump of FFI relevant information into SQLite database. This allows to query
  specific information per source file or SW module base.

Known limitation(s):
- Compile time operators maybe listed as function calls (e.g. sizeof()).
- Missing source files recursive search in sub folders
- Macros resolution: as of now function macros are stored in dedicated table
  (Functions_Macros). No support yet to run tool against preprocessed files (
  only .c and .h files are currently supported).
- Resolution of function pointers (to be discussed if this feature falls into
  funcParser static analysis of source code)
